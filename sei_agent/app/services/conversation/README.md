# Conversational Engine

This module implements an advanced conversational AI system building upon concepts from:
- ELIZA (MIT, 1966) - Pattern matching and response generation
- Modern NLP techniques for context awareness
- Blockchain-specific analytics integration

## Attribution
The pattern matching and conversation flow mechanics are inspired by ELIZA 
(Joseph Weizenbaum, MIT, 1966). We've extended these concepts for blockchain 
analytics and social trading education.

## Enhancements to Original ELIZA Framework
- Context persistence across conversations
- Real-time data integration
- Domain-specific knowledge base
- Sentiment analysis
- Educational scaffolding
